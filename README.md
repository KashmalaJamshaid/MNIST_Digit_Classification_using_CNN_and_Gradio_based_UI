# MNIST_Digit_Classification_using_CNN_and_Gradio_based_UI
This Python application is based on Hand Written Digits. Tensorflow and Gradio were used as the key requirements for coding. 
* TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. 
* Gradio allows you to quickly create customizable UI components around your TensorFlow or PyTorch models, or even arbitrary Python functions.

# Sample example:
If the code is successfully executed, you will see the interface below, or you may go to the link provided. Draw your digit in the Image area, and Gradio will show you the output in the next window.
