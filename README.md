# MNIST_Digit_Classification_using_CNN_and_Gradio_based_UI
This Python application is based on Hand Written Digits. Tensorflow and Gradio were used as the key requirements for coding.  TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.  Gradio allows you to quickly create customizable UI components around your TensorFlow or PyTorch models, or even arbitrary Python functions.
